A client server implementation in python for the number guess problem.
The server chooses a random number.
The clients connect and send numbers to server. The server returns to each client a status message:
- ‘H’ – send a larger number
- ‘S’ – send a lower number
- ‘L’ – another client guessed the number. You are a looser!
